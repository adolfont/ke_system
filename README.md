# Ke System

My initial goal here is to provide an implementation of a tool for teaching the KE System for classical propositional logic.

The student can build its own proofs and verify if they are correct.

The student can choose a problem (a sequent) and try to solve it.

The student can create its own problem. 

If you want to know more about the KE System, which is a kind of tableau system created by Marco Mondadori, read [
